## R Markdown

#### lower level title

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** _button_ _italics_ a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#### this below is good for reproducable working
1 + 5 = `r 1+5`
```r
1+4
```

```{r}
I want this to be evaluated
```

#### this below is actually evaluated, not like the below bc of the {r cars}
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
